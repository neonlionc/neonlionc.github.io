<h4> Thoughts on the new patch including the Akali rework</h4>
<p2> To begin with, let's talk about the Akali rework. Her kit seems a little too overpowered, making her a high ceiling skill based champ. Also, looking at her winrate right now its really bad but this is to be expected for any new champ. However, this will inevitably lead to buffs as RIOT has done so often in the past to new champs so it must be seen how broken she is in the next pathc or the one after. <br /> Moving on
